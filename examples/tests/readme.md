## Tests

Here you will find notebooks that used to test some functionality at some point during the development. These are not the official software tests (those are in the c++ part of the code). These are just simple python test to check simple implementations. Don't expect these notebooks te to be clean, commented or ordered. However, we decided to leave them here since they could be helpful for some users.
